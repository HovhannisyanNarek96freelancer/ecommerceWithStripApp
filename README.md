# Ecommerce website
https://best-watches-for-you.vercel.app/

I developed a custom ecommerce website that showcased the client's watches in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate way. I implemented smooth scrolling, dynamic transitions, and interactive animations to enhance the user experience and showcase the client's products.

For the server side, I set up a Sanity Studio, which allowed the client to easily add, update, and manage their ecommerce website data, including product descriptions, images, and prices. I ensured that the server was secure, scalable, and easily integratable with the ecommerce website.
